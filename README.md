## Requirements

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center)
- [Node.js 8.0+](http://nodejs.org)
- [Vue](http://vuejs.org)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

## Development

### Install for Windows

Node.js is a portable javsacript runtime that uses the Chrome's V8 engine to execute scripts outside of the browser. [Click here to learn more about node.js](http://nodejs.org/about/)

### Step 1: Install Node.js
If you like clicking the next button on installers, you can go to [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/) and download the latest version of node for Windows. Once it is installed, proceed to step 2.

Great news! Now you have a package manager for Windows! The next step is to install the node.js package. 

### Step 2: Install Git
In order for our build system to access them, we need git installed. 

Once again, you have two choices- install the old fashioned way or use chocolatey. To install from a browser download, go to [http://git-scm.com/download/win](http://git-scm.com/download/win) and grab the latest version. **Note: when you install with the gui installer, make sure you select the option to 'Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt'**

### Step 3: Confirm %PATH% has all of the prerequisites
Open up a fresh command prompt instance and verify that node and npm are available on the system path. The easiest way to do this is to type in ``where node`` and ``where git`` in the command prompt. Both of these commands should return valid local paths to their respective excecutable files. 

It is worth noting that your path variable in Windows can only be 260 characters. If you run out of space in your path, you will have to remove a couple of the useless entries to make room for node and npm. The result of ``set path`` should include both ``%APPDATA%\npm`` and ``C:\Program Files\nodejs`` as well as the directory containing your git installation.

### Step 4: Install MongoDB

https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/

### Step 5: Clone repository

Next, type ``git clone https://github.com/intelligo-systems/mcute.git`` and press enter to clone repo. 

### Step 6: Install the Project's Dependencies
Next, type ``npm i`` and press enter to install all of the node modules registered in the package.json. 

For your convenience, we have added a post-install step that will automatically download and install the bower packages as well. To acheive the same result manually, you would have to use the ``bower install`` command after the ``npm i`` process finished running.

### Install MongoDB OSX

#### Downloading MongoDB .tgz file
Visit MongoDB official website https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community and download the .tgz file from the community section of the website.
Now extract the downloded .tgz and mv the mongo directory to /usr/local/mongodb directory using following command in terminal.

```
$ cd ~/Download
$ tar -zxvf mongodb-osx-ssl-x86_64-4.0.6.tgz
$ sudo mv mongodb-osx-ssl-x86_64-4.0.6.tgz /usr/local/mongodb
```

#### Create MongoDB Data directory (/data/db)
MongoDB stores the data into the /data/db directory by default, so we need to create this directory and also assign proper permission using chown command.
Open the terminal run the following command
```
$ sudo mkdir -p /data/db
$ whoami
turtuvshin
$ sudo chown turtuvshin /data/db
```

#### Set mongodb/bin PATH to ~/.bash_profile
Now we need to set the envirent variable for MongoDb, So the mongo and mongod command can be recognized from the terminal.
For that we need to add the mongodb/bin path to the ~/.bash_profile file.
```
$ cd
$ pwd
/Users/turtuvshin
# if .bash_profile is not present follow the step 
# to create it otherwise skip the step below.
$ touch .bash_profile
$ open .bash_profile
Now .bash_profile file will open in a text editor. In this file add the following exports

export PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/bin:$PATH
```

Now restart your terminal and verify the mongodb version by following commands

```
$ mongo -version
MongoDB shell version: 4.0.6
```

#### Start MongoDB
In order to work with mongodb we need to first run the mongod command which starts the mongo daemon .
So open two different terminals.
Now in

##### terminal 1
run the following command

```
$ mongod
MongoDB starting : pid=38042 port=27017 dbpath=/data/db/ 64-bit host=codebind.local3
//...
waiting for connections on port 27017
```

Now in

##### terminal 2
run the following command

```
$ mongo
MongoDB shell version: 3.6.1
connecting to: test
> show dbs
local	(empty)
admin	(empty)
```

## Running

Clone the repository, then

Install dependencies:
* `npm install` from the root folder
* `cd frontend && npm install` from the root folder

Build and Start:
* `npm run dev`: first-in-class development experience.
  - Webpack + `vue-loader` for single file Vue components.
  - State preserving hot-reload
  - State preserving compilation error overlay
  - Lint-on-save with ESLint
  - Source maps

* `npm run build`: Production ready build.
  - JavaScript minified with [UglifyJS v3](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/tree/harmony).
  - HTML minified with [html-minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier).
  - CSS across all components extracted into a single file and minified with [cssnano](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano).
  - Static assets compiled with version hashes for efficient long-term caching, and an auto-generated production `index.html` with proper URLs to these generated assets.
  - Use `npm run build --report`to build with bundle size analytics.

* `npm start` from the root folder
  * alternatively: run `node app.js`
  

## Deploy

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

### Deploy to Heroku

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a9/Heroku_logo.png" width="200">

- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- In terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials
- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`
- Run `heroku addons:create mongolab`.  This will set up the mLab add-on and configure the `DB_URI` environment variable in your Heroku app for you.
- Lastly, do `git push heroku master`.  Done!

**Note:** To install Heroku add-ons your account must be verified.

<img src="https://mlab.com/company/img/branding/mLab-logo-onlight.svg" width="200">

- Open [mlab.com](https://mlab.com) website
- Click the yellow **Sign up** button
- Fill in your user information then hit **Create account**
- From the dashboard, click on **:zap:Create new** button
- Select **any** cloud provider (I usually go with AWS)
- Under *Plan* click on **Single-node (development)** tab and select **Sandbox** (it's free)
 - *Leave MongoDB version as is - `2.4.x`*
- Enter *Database name** for your web app
- Then click on **:zap:Create new MongoDB deployment** button
- Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user
- Click to the recently created database
- You should see the following message:
 - *A database user is required to connect to this database.* **Click here** *to create a new one.*
- Click the link and fill in **DB Username** and **DB Password** fields
- Finally, in `.env` instead of `mongodb://localhost:27017/test`, use the following URI with your credentials:
 - `db: 'mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@ds027479.mongolab.com:27479/DATABASE_NAME'`

**Note:** As an alternative to mLab, there is also [Compose](https://www.compose.io/).
